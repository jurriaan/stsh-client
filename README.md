Take a screenshot in OS X and have a URL to the picture in your pasteboard a second later.

*A free and open source version of the different commercial variants (GrabUp, Tiny Grab, etc).*

For Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.


## Building

You'll need libpngcrush to build stsh-client. libpngcrush is an external submodule of stsh-client which you'll need to update after you've checked out the stsh-client source:

	cd stsh-client
	git submodule update --init pngcrush

You only need to do this once. Now, build Scrup in Xcode.
